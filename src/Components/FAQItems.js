        question: "What do the A and B designations stand for that I see in certain IGNITE classes?",
        answer: "You will notice certain classes have two sections designated A or B.  Certain years, large class sizes require us to split classes in half.  Sometimes if the classes are homogenous in skills and in that case we offer section 1 and section 2.  But if students have different skill levels, A and B designations are used so that students who are just entering that level will be recommended for the A class and students who may have more experience at this level will be recommended for the more advanced B class."

        question: "What is the student teacher program?",
        answer: "Synergy has a instituted a mutli-faceted approach to the use of student teachers to ensure a quality experience for both the students in class and the student teacher.  Our student teachers participate in our STEP program.  The first phase requires 25 hours of written observations of professional teaching staff.  Student teachers are then placed for 1 or 2 years as teaching assistants in studio classes, intensives and/or camps where they are afforded opportunities to teach portions of class with feedback from the teacher. When students have demonstrated the ability to plan and execute classes, mentor teachers can recommend student teachers to be assigned to their own classes.  These first experiences are supervised 100% by professional teachers who engage in a dialogue with the student teacher to guide class planning and to offer feedback for improving their skills.  Gradually fading supervision occurs based on the assessment by the mentor teacher until a student teacher is deemed an independent teacher.  After that continued observation and interaction with mentor teacher assist student teachers to continue to refine their skills."

IGNITE classes are skill based classes where students are expected to achieve all skills at the prior level before advancing regardless of age."

        question: "Can I start classes in the middle of a Session?",
        answer: "If space is available, dancers may enroll in the middle of any Session except Sesson 4.  Tuition will be pro-rated for the number of weeks attending.  We discourage students from beginning in our last session of the year.  By that time, students in classes have been working to develop a certain level of strength and skill that make it harder for new students to start at this point. In addition, during Session 4 classes have begun preparing for the annual recital making it more difficult for newer students to start at this time."

For young students, performing is an important skill just like any other dance skill and therefore we consider it a important part of their training."
