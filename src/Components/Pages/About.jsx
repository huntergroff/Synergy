          Our focus at Synergy Dance is to instill a love of dance in our entire community. 
          Our students will find themselves in an environment where they feel safe to express 
          themselves on the dance floor and will be challenged to continue to achieve. At Synergy 
          Dance we believe that a solid technical foundation is critical in the development of a 
          successful dancer. Our teachers provide instruction that combines proper technique with a 
          balance of fun that enables all our students to reach the highest level of dancing that will 
          carry them through a lifetime love of dance.
